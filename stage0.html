    <b> The World Wide Web </b> <br>
    HTML is the most common document type used on the web. <br>
    Your browser makes requests via the internet to servers using a http protcol. <br>
    The server responds with files that are displayed on the browser.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b> HTML Basics </b> <br>
    HTML is made up of text content, markup, references to documents, and links to other pages. <br>
    HTML markup is made up of tags which usually precede (opening tag) and succeed (closing tag) the contents. <br>
    The entire entity composed of tags and contents are called elements. <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> Types of Tags </b> <br>
    The "b" tag is used to make text <b> bold </b>. <br>
    The "em" tag is used to make text <em> emphasized </em> or <em> italicized. </em> <br>
    The "a" tag is used to <a href = "udacity.com"> anchor </a> text or link them to other pages. <br>
    The "p" tag is used to create paragraphs or blocks of text; which is also why it's called a block element. <br>
    The "br" tag is usde to create a line break, but does not create a box around the text; this makes it an inline element. <br>
    <span class = "foo"> The "span" tag contain its contents while allowing specific styles or attributes to it; it is an inline element. </span>
    <div class = "bar"> The "div" tag, like the "span" tag, simply contains its contents; however, this is a block element. </div>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b> Document Structure </b> <br>
    The first line should contain the document type, which is simply HTML when using html5. <br>
    The "html" tag opens the document and everything contained in the document should be between the opening and closing html tags. <br>
    The "head" tag defines metadata for the webpage which includes the title, as well as any references to javascript or css files. <br>
    The "body" tag contains the actual contents of the document.
  </p>
  <b> Other Notes </b> <br>
  -HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. <br>
  -HTML is not whitespace sensitive. <br>
  -Because computers intake all information literally, programmers have to be diligent in their coding to ensure the computer is able to process the code correctly. <br>
